Based on Feick, Tang and Krugerâ€™s research, HapticPuppet is a drone-based interface that enables
kinesthetic haptic feedback by providing multidirectional force in the mid-air. The HapticPuppet works by
using strings to attach multiple coordinated drones to different parts of the human body such as hands,
fingers or arms. HapticPuppet has a wide range of applications, such as augmented reality, virtual reality,
rehabilitation exercise and remote collaboration (Feick et al., 2022).
In my project, I use AirSim to simulate HapticPuppet. I simulate the user's hand, strings and drones in
AirSim, and realize and measure the force generated by the drone on the hand. In addition to this, I
simulate a real-world scenario of exercising using the HapticPuppet as a rehabilitation belt.
